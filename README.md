UNL Computer Science 1 work that got me an A

I used AI to help me write some of this code when stuck, but most of the work is by me. Most of these codes were just thrown together and are not optomized at all. This was my first real computer science class and I am not that great yet. This work is not to be used by anyone academic way but me. This is all original work with some ai assistance.
